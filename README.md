XMoto.io
========

Social layer and backend for replays, on top of [XMoto.js](https://github.com/MichaelHoste/xmoto.js).

The social layer will be inspired by another project of mine : http://sokoban-game.com ([GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelHoste/sokoban)). This game got 3000+ registered users and 100 000+ levels solved in less than a year, with almost no communication (only Facebook).

This is the **second** part of a 2-parts project:
 1. [XMoto.js](https://github.com/MichaelHoste/xmoto.js): JavaScript port of the game that need to be compatible with a lot of pre-existing levels (XML files) from the original game.
 2. [XMoto.io](https://github.com/MichaelHoste/xmoto.io) (this project!): social XMoto game with a backend for scores, replays, etc.

More about the project development on http://xmoto.io

## Demo

an ugly / bugged / not complete alpha version is frequently deployed here: http://alpha.xmoto.io

Currently the best scores and replays of each user for each level are saved in the backend. That alpha version is not yet for production and your scores will be erased from time to time.

## Usage

This is a standard Rails application.

## TODO

Allow users to play against the replays of their friends!
